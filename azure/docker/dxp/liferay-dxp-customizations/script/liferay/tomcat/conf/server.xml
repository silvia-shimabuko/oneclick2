            A "Connector" represents an endpoint by which requests are received
            and responses are returned.

            Protocol "HTTP/1.1" selects either:
               * 'org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol' (BIO) or
               * 'org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol' (APR)

            To use non-blocking Java connector, use protocol:
               * 'org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol' (NIO)
               * 'org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Nio2Protocol' (NIO2)

            See https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/http.html#Connector_Comparison
        -->

        <!--
            Keep a small purely HTTP connector as a backup. Keep the threads count
            limited, as this should never be used for real end-user traffic from ELB.

            GSMS-115
            We want to use bindOnInit="false", to make sure Tomcat binds to a
            TCP socket only after the connector is fully started. This is useful
            for health check, since nginx can then see Tomcat as 'down' also while
            it is starting / stopping. Especially starting might take a long time
            for fresh Liferay bundle.
