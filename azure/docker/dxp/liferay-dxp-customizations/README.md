# DXP Customization layer

This Docker project builds the customization layer. You should run *scripts/build-docker-and-push-images.sh* to build this layer. The image generated by this project will be the final image deployed to Azure.

This layer already provides basic configuration for clustering, elastic search, etc, with recommended configurations to run the portal on Azure, but you can do your own changes to suit your needs.

## Directory structure

### configs

Configurations dir. Add new portal-ext and cfg files to customize the portal. Notice that presented configurations are ready to use with Azure and will override existing values. You should use this directory to place general configuration that are applicable to all projects using the final container. It is possible to customize properties using[portal-ext.user.properties](config/portal-ext.user.properties) file, without rebuilding the image. After properties are changed you must reload the portal (restart the pods).

## deploy

This is where you should drop all files generated by your Liferay Workspaces (jars, wars, etc).

## license

Drop your license here.

## script

Place here scripts that will run during docker build time to perform custom configurations. You will notice that tomcat is configured by running a script. You should not remove the existing scripts, but add new scripts to suit your needs.
