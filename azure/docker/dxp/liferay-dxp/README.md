# Vanilla portal build

You need to create a file envXXX.sh
where XXX is an identification of dxp version

setup the file with:
    VERSION: is the same value of XXX
    DXP_FILENAME: is the dxp zip file name (include the extension .zip)

You will need a bundle to run this project, specifically this one:

for instance: `liferay-dxp-tomcat-7.1.10-ga1-20180703090613030.zip`
